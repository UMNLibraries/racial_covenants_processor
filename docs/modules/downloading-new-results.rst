Downloading new batches of Zooniverse results
=============================================

1. Export updated manual corrections in case something goes wrong, though you generally won't need to reload these (just re-join) unless your database needs to be completely rebuilt

.. code-block:: bash

    python manage.py dump_manual_corrections --workflow "WI Milwaukee County"
    python manage.py dump_extra_parcels --workflow "WI Milwaukee County"

2. Create and download a fresh Zooniverse export from the Zooniverse Lab tab.  
    A. Click Lab > Data Exports > Request new workflow classification export  
    B. Click Lab > Data Exports > Request new workflow export  
    C. Download files once notified by email.  
    D. Place downloaded files in a folder named the workflow slugs. (I retain old versions of this folder by renaming with a date stamp, e.g. your-workflow-slug-20240401):

    ::

        racial_covenants_processor
        ├── racial_covenants_processor
            ├── data
                ├── zooniverse_exports
                    |── your-workflow-slug/

    E. If necessary, rename downloaded files to ``your-workflow-slug-classifications.csv`` (e.g. ``wi-milwaukee-county-classifications.csv``) and ``your-workflow-slug-workflows.csv`` (e.g. ``wi-milwaukee-county-workflows.csv``)

3. Process exported batch results from Zooniverse (Using command line tools)

.. code-block:: bash
  
    python manage.py generate_zooniverse_export --workflow "WI Milwaukee County"

4. Load raw and aggregated Zooniverse responses into individual property matches

.. code-block:: bash
    
    python manage.py load_zooniverse_export --slow --workflow "WI Milwaukee County"

5. Join deed images to zooniverse subjects

.. code-block:: bash
    
    python manage.py join_deeds_to_subjects --workflow "WI Milwaukee County"

6. Re-join manual corrections to subjects

.. code-block:: bash
    
    python manage.py connect_manual_corrections --workflow "WI Milwaukee County"
    python manage.py connect_extra_parcels --workflow "WI Milwaukee County"

7. Automated join of matches to modern parcel map

.. code-block:: bash
    
    python manage.py rebuild_covenant_spatial_lookups --workflow "WI Milwaukee County"
    python manage.py match_parcels --workflow "WI Milwaukee County"

8. Manual cleanup as needed.
9. Export shapefile/data layers

.. code-block:: bash

    python manage.py dump_covenants_shapefile --workflow "WI Milwaukee County"
    python manage.py dump_covenants_geojson --workflow "WI Milwaukee County"
    python manage.py dump_covenants_csv --workflow "WI Milwaukee County"
